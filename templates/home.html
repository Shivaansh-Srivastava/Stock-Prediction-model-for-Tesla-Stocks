            <p id="one">
                In Stock Price Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning 
                which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. 
                The project focuses on the use of Regression based Machine learning to predict stock values. The entire idea of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits.

                Stock Price Prediction using machine learning helps you discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. There are other factors involved 
                in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. 
                This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy.
